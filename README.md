# AeroVision Studios - Landing Page

This project is a responsive single-page landing website for AeroVision Studios, a fictional drone videography service. It showcases the company's services, portfolio, client testimonials, and provides a contact form.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the landing page.
- `css/style.css`: Contains all the styles for the website, including dark mode.
- `js/main.js`: Handles interactivity, form validation, dark mode toggle, and portfolio carousel.
- `privacy-policy.html`: A placeholder page for the Privacy Policy.
- `terms-of-service.html`: A placeholder page for the Terms of Service.
- `images/`: Directory for images (currently contains `.gitkeep`).
- `videos/`: Directory for videos (currently contains `.gitkeep`).

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
